INVESTIGATION
</div>
The Indian society has traditionally been non-inclusive in multiple aspects. There are various barriers including, but not limited to, language, location, gender, disabilities, and income. Since our project was related to women's reproductive health, we encountered many of them early on.  
<br><br>
Discussions about reproductive health are often considered a taboo in the society. Moreover, women asking for medical help are often labelled attention-seeking. This mentality is not just limited to men, but is often embraced by other women too. This causes great neglect of women centered issues by both society and the government. 
<br><br>
In India, science is mostly taught in English, due to the lack of native translators well versed in scientific language. This creates a vicious cycle, where few of these native speakers are able to join the scientific circles, leading to fewer science communicators. This also creates a disparity based on location, where students in less developed regions are at a natural disadvantage as compared to others. 
<br><br>
A similar situation can be seen among the people suffering from various disabilities, where even though primary material has been developed in the recent years, advanced materials and new research are yet to be adapted.  
<br><br>
We also identified that there is a disparity in the level of education between private and public schools, especially in science education. This can be due to the poor facilities of labs and overburdened classrooms. It is also due to the outdated curriculum, where recent advances in fields like synthetic biology and biotechnology are not accounted for.

TEAM SELECTION
</div>
Our team this year included people from 14 states this year, speaking more than 18 languages in total. This helped us implement our language project successfully where we translated our content into multiple Indian languages. Our team also included 7 female members out of the 17 student members, helping us get the perspective better for a disease mostly affecting women. 
<br><br>
iGEM at IISc has traditionally been undertaken by students in the BS Research course, owing specially to their background in research. However, we realised that new avenues in the project can be unlocked if the students of B Tech programme are invited too. We took special steps to attract them to the iGEM ecosystem, such as presentations at the CS club launch and the Rising Dry Lab program. 
<br><br>
Indeed, at the end, we benefitted greatly this year, and we hope our program includes more computational aspects in the coming years.

From the ground-up, our colour scheme was designed to be both visually appealing and satisfying the W3C Contrast rules to be properly visible on posters and wikis. We decided on using a monochromatic color scheme. With multiple shades (base colour + black), tones (base color + gray) and tints (base color + white).
<br><br>
Colour Blind Friendly : The monochromatic colour scheme helps to prevent confusion. We simulated how the colour palette would look like on individuals with protanopia, deuteranopia or tritanopia. We also simulated the palette as it looks to people who have deuteranomaly

LANGUAGE PROJECT
</div>
Based on multiple feedback we received, we translated our articles and brochures into 18 Languages covering 93% population of India. Here, our team’s diversity helped us a lot, where most of the translations were undertaken by them. They also confirmed the few translations we got with the help of Google Translate. The articles can be found under our education page.

BIOTECH IN SCHOOLS
</div>
We visited schools in 9 states of the country, including many backward states like Jharkhand and Odisha to spread awareness about life in research and synthetic biology. We also collaborated with Notebook Drive to visit government schools, where we interacted with those students and made simplified activity sheets to teach them about science. The sheets can be accessed on our educational page.

Although current and potential treatments for endometriosis like hysterectomy and monoclonal antibodies do exist, the high cost and long-term health impact (especially for hysterectomy) act as major deterrents for patients. This is much more apparent in lower-middle-income countries like India, with a average household income of $2,466[1], as indicated by the various surveys taken by patients and gynecologists alike. In our survey too, we found out that most participants would not undertake surgery for non-lethal diseases like endometriosis.

<br><br>
Taking these facts into account, we have shaped our project around mRNA vaccines, aiming for it to be affordable and easy to access. Our work towards SDG#1 also contributes towards SDG#8 (decent work and economic growth) and SDG#10 (reducing inequalities) by enabling affected patients to re-enter the workforce.  
<br><br>
<div class = "text-6xl text-violet-500 courierprimebold">
SDG#3: Good Health
</div>
As explained on our homepage, endometriosis is a severe and widespread disease that causes extreme pain and reduced reproductive health. Although some treatments do exist, they each have their set of problems - as outlined by various doctors and specialists. Keeping this in mind, we hope our project succeeds in relieving affected patients via an effective treatment for endometriosis with no immediate and long-term side effects.  
<br><br>
<div class = "text-6xl text-violet-500 courierprimebold">
SDG#4: Quality Education
</div>
In addition to devising a treatment for endometriosis, we have taken this opportunity to educate the public on various topics like endometriosis, women sexual health, synthetic biology and its impact, life in research, etc. This was accomplished through various events like science camps, talks, symposiums, quizzes and meetings.  
<br><br>
Through our efforts, we aim to make considerable progress towards SDG#4, with special emphasis on targets 4.4 (technical and vocational skills) and 4.7 (knowledge for further SD)  


<br><br>
<div class = "text-6xl text-violet-500 courierprimebold">
SDG#5: Gender Equality
</div>
To combat this condition that affects a large fraction of the global female population, we have requested help from a diverse range of stakeholders like patients, doctors, specialists and government officials. Additionally, by pursuing SDG#4: Education, we have brought to light the lack of control many women have over their own sexual health, especially if maintaining it becomes a costly affair. 
<br><br>
<div class = "text-6xl text-violet-500 courierprimebold">
SDG#9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure  
</div>
We have developed an extensive business model where we have laid down the timeline to commercialize our product, including the setup of industry and procurement of fixed and working capital. We discussed the same with Jitendra Kumar, from the Bangalore Bioinnovation Centre, who informed us about the need to develop the mRNA therapeutic industry in the country. Our business model too is derived from the WHO’s mRNA technology transfer platform. 
<br><br>
It would, in the long run, be associated with SDG#8: decent work and economic growth, and SDG#12: responsible consumption and production, since we would emphasize good working conditions and sustainability in industrial expansion.  

<br><br>
<div class = "text-6xl text-violet-500 courierprimebold">
SDG#17: Partnerships
</div>
As scientists, we must take the first step towards international collaboration by exchanging ideas, skills and results. And by teaming up with multiple iGEM teams and companies across the globe we have done just that. Seeing how teams of young scientists came together for a common goal- to treat endometriosis- we hope to promote further collaborations, not only between scientists, but also among countries and their governments.
